# Full Stack Developer Assessment

---

This repository contains the code used in the interview process for a full-stack developer position at Schooldocs.

There are two parts to this solution, and depending on the type of role you are applying for, you will be asked to contribute to one or both areas.

Remember that _maintainability and clarity_ are key in your solution. You are welcome to use comments in the code to outline any assumptions you might make and/or outline your thinking at various points. Once completed, you can either push the completed solution to your _own repo_ and send us the link.
